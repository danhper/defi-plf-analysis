    "# 1. Plot the series; argue whether potentially integrated I(0) or I(1); see whether any equation should specify a trend\n",
    "# 2. Establish an argument in favour of cointegration. E.g. people will transfer funds to the highest interest bearing currency if the interest rates differ\n",
    "# 3. Establish number of lags to use when testing for cointegration. (varsoc in stata)\n",
    "# 4. Test for cointegration (vecrank in stata). Using all the series, how many cointegrating relationships are there?\n",
    "# 5. Present results of VECM. See if results are significant (look at the vecintro example). If they are significant, interpret them.abs\n",
    "# 6. Perform robustness checks. In order for inference to be correct, the cointegrating equations must display stationarity. \n",
